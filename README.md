# LinkedList
this program i basically created a simple singly linked list using c++.It helps to implement linked list using array.
And i have added few functions such as:
1.Insertion at the beginning.
2.Insertion at last
3.Insertion at end
4.Length of list
5.Display 
The program can help one to thoroughly understand the working of singly linked list.
i have also provide few sample inputs by default.
